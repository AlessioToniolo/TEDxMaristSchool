            TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. It
            started out (in 1984) as a conference bringing together people from
            three worlds: Technology, Entertainment, Design. Since then its
            scope has become ever broader. Along with two annual conferences —
            the TED Conference in Long Beach and Palm Springs each spring, and
            the TEDGlobal conference in Edinburgh UK each summer — TED includes
            the award-winning TEDTalks video site, the Open Translation Project
            and TED Conversations, the inspiring TED Fellows and TEDx programs,
            and the annual TED Prize.
